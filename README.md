# Brick-Pong
a game I made using c++, with raylib

to run the game, you might need to have Visual Studio and raylib installed

the game is a spin on the classic "Pong" game, with 3 variations of brick patterns in the middle. The bricks break upon being hit by the ball and increase the ball's speed by 5%. 
the game can be played human-human, human-AI, AI-human or you can let the game run as AI-AI.

The controls for choosing the players, moving the paddles and changing shooting direction is W-S for the left and up-down arrow keys for the right.

Have fun :)
